# Dotfiles

![neofetch-2017-04-29-01-35-23-3548](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9076747/25555533/1e16f77a-2ce9-11e7-9175-0914c5b5e73c.png)

My dotfiles, save me a few seconds when reinstalling my system. Also allow me to synchronize my configuration between multiple workstations. 

## Installation:

Whilst you will be able to use the `install.sh` script, you probably won't manage to get everything to work properly as it is intended for my own use. But feel free to manually browse files !
 
    git clone git@github.com:hg8/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh
 
    #Install all Vim bundled plugins:
    :PluginInstall
    #Update plugins :
    :PluginUpdate
