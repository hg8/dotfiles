My dotfiles, save me a few seconds when reinstalling my system. Also allow me to synchronize my configuration between multiple workstations. 

## Installation:

Whilst you will be able to use the `install.sh` script, you probably won't manage to get everything to work properly as it is intended for my own use. But feel free to manually browse files !

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hg8/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
 
# Install all Vim bundled plugins:
:PluginInstall
# Update plugins :
:PluginUpdate
```
