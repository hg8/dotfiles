My dotfiles, save me a few seconds when reinstalling my system. Also allow me to synchronize my configuration between multiple workstations. 

##Installation:

Whilst you will be able to use the `install.sh` script, you probably won't manage to get everything to work properly as it is intended for my own use. But feel free to manually browse files !
 
    git clone git@github.com:hg8/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh
 
    #Install all Vim bundled plugins:
    :PluginInstall
    #Update plugins :
    :PluginUpdate
